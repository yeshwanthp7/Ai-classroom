# AI Class Monitoring — MEMORY.md

## Project Overview & Mission
Class AI is an AI-powered classroom monitoring application that uses artificial intelligence to track student engagement, provide real-time insights, and help educators create better learning environments.

## Tech Stack & Versions
- **Framework:** Next.js 16.2.9 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.x + shadcn/ui
- **Icons:** lucide-react
- **Animation:** Three.js (CDN-loaded, shader-based)
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Node Structure:** `src/` directory with `@/*` import alias

## Architecture & Core Decisions
- **Dark Mode First:** The app uses dark theme by default (`.dark` class on `<html>`)
- **shadcn/ui:** Initialized with default config; components live in `src/components/ui/`
- **Shader Animation:** Three.js is loaded dynamically via CDN script tag (not bundled) to keep bundle size small
- **Loading Screen:** Custom loading screen with shader background + logo plays on initial page load before revealing the landing page
- **Branding:** Purple/violet color palette (#7c3aed range), "Class AI" brand name
